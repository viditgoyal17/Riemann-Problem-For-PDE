# Riemann-Problem-For-PDE
This project has been an enriching voyage into the realm of computational fluid dynamics, delving deeply into the intricacies of Riemann problems, shock waves, and rarefactions. Through meticulous study and hands-on implementation, I have garnered a profound understanding of various numerical methodologies, including Godunov's, Lax-Friedrichs, and Lax-Wendroff methods. By employing these techniques in MATLAB, I have gained practical insights into their behaviors, strengths, and limitations when applied to solving the linear advection equation. 

All the Tests and schemes are derived from the book "Riemann Solvers and Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics: A Practical Introduction" by Eleuterio F. Toro.
